# 3Design Concepts Engine  
### Real-Time Architectural & Urban Simulation  
*(Three.js + Cannon.js)*

![3Design Concepts Engine Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106228791/235469331-5abd37c6-c7bc-4830-9f17-6cc351f5c96c.jpg)

**3Design Concepts Engine** is a **real-time 3D browser-based simulation engine** built with **Three.js** and **Cannon.js**, designed for **architectural visualization, urban exploration, and spatial interaction**.  
It is optimized for **mobile devices** while maintaining high-quality rendering on desktop browsers.

The engine transforms architectural models into **walkable, drivable, and explorable environments**, enabling designers and students to experience space at **human scale**—directly in the web browser.

## Purpose & Vision

Traditional architectural tools focus on static representation.  
**3Design Concepts Engine** focuses on **spatial experience**.

It is designed to support:
- Architecture theses
- Urban design studies
- Virtual city prototyping
- Interactive design presentations
- Mobile architectural walkthroughs

The engine bridges **SketchUp / Blender / Rhino** workflows with **real-time web-based environments**.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Performance-Driven Spatial Loading

The engine dynamically:
- Loads nearby assets
- Unloads distant objects
- Optimizes browser memory usage

This ensures smooth performance on mobile devices and reflects real architectural perception—only nearby space defines experience.

## Three.js + Cannon.js as Design Analogies

| Technology | Architectural Meaning |
|----------|------------------------|
| Three.js | Geometry, materials, form |
| Cannon.js | Gravity, mass, physical realism |
| Levels | Urban districts / design phases |
| Avatars | Human scale & circulation |
| Vehicles | Infrastructure & mobility |
| Rules | Program, constraints, behavior |

Together, they form a **living architectural system**, not just a game engine.

---

## Interaction Model (Non-Violent)

The engine follows **non-violent interaction rules**, ideal for academic and professional use:

- Walking & running
- Jumping & waving
- Driving vehicles
- Social presence & shared spaces

The focus remains on **space, movement, and experience**.

## Engine Structure


---

### avatars.js — Human Scale Controller
- Avatar parameters & movement
- Mixamo-rigged characters
- Ready Player Me avatars
- First-person & third-person navigation

---

### levels.js — Environment & Urban Design
Controls:
- Sky, lighting, shadows
- Water & environment effects
- Buildings, roads, bridges
- Platforms, islands, streetscapes

Acts as the **digital site model**.

---

### vehicles.js — Mobility & Infrastructure
- Vehicle chassis & wheels
- Physics-based movement
- Collision systems
- Urban circulation simulation

---

### rules.js — Program & Behavioral Logic
Defines:
- Health & stamina (rest, sleep, recovery)
- Economy (renting, services, insurance)
- Progression between design phases / levels

Mirrors **architectural programming and constraints**.

---

## Workflow Example


No installation.  
No plugins.  
Accessible on desktop and mobile browsers.

---

## Use Cases

- Architectural thesis projects
- Virtual city environments
- Urban mobility studies
- Web-based design presentations
- Interactive spatial simulations

---

## Statement

**3Design Concepts Engine** is not a game engine.  
It is a **real-time spatial design platform** where architecture becomes **interactive, experiential, and accessible through the web**.
